Juicy Shmup is, at its core, a top-down shoot 'em up. Taking inspiration from [Juicy Breakout](http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/), I wanted to build a simple game that felt satisfying to play. That means crisp sounds, particle effects, screen shake, and all that good stuff--all while keeping the core loop the same.

## Key Features

* Satisfying camera shake
* Tons of particle effects combined with Box2DLights
