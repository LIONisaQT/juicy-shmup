Juicy Shmup is, at its core, a top-down shoot 'em up. Taking inspiration from [Juicy Breakout](http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/), I wanted to build a simple game that felt satisfying to play. That means crisp sounds, particle effects, screen shake, and all that good stuff--all while keeping the core loop the same.

## Key Features (or at least, stuff I want to implement soon)

* Satisfying camera shake, juiced by math
* Tons of particle effects, combined with Box2DLights
* Scaling difficulty from score delta and raw score
* A ton of weapons!
